The aim of the course is to expose participants to practical data analysis and visualisation work and equip them with the necessary knowledge and exposure to further develop your data science skills. Split into four parts, the course will walk through essential programming and data tools like version control, collaboration platforms, virtual machines and databases. Thereafter, we cover data manipulation with the python programming language using the pandas library. We will then use what we have learnt about data databases and data analysis to create an interactive web-based dashboard. To finish we will spend time further exploring topics and tools in data visualisation.
