### Python programming

I recommend [Zed Shaw](https://twitter.com/zedshaw)'s [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) for beginners. It is filled with both detailed and practical advice that are mostly missing in other introductory texts. Also, it is witty. If you're beyond the beginner phase and wan't to go head first into working with data, I strongly recommend reading [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do), by Wes McKinney (main author of the pandas library). It is by far the best Python data analysis book out there and probably one of the best books on the topic in any language. 

The following Python modules are all very useful for scientific computing:
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/stable/)

You will see all of these modules, and many more, in use in the code snippets in the wiki.

Also, following these people/companies/accounts on Twitter, for example, will help you stay up to date on the latest developments in the Python scientific computing community:

* [Continuum Analytics](https://twitter.com/ContinuumIO)
* [Planet Python](https://twitter.com/planetpython)

### Websites

Once again this is not an attempt at being exhaustive, but rather my own view. I try to limit my technology-related information intake online to a few sources and in practice they end up being mainly:

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lcdutoit), depending on who you follow of course
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), since it is a very clean aggregator of news and mostly pinned with useful comments

Another popular news aggregator similar to Hacker News is [slashdot](http://slashdot.org/), which you might like.
